4036.6.3: : Designs and Develops an ML/AI Product

The learner designs and develops a fully functional ML/AI product that addresses the needs of a business problem or organizational need.

Introduction

* * *

In this task, you will have the opportunity to showcase your skills in creating a GitLab repository for your AI/ML product, developing a fully functional solution to a business problem, and effectively communicating your findings.

  

You will start by setting up your GitLab repository and cloning the project to your IDE. Throughout the development process, you will be committing and pushing your progress to ensure that your work is backed up and accessible. Remember to submit the repository URL and branch history when you complete the assessment.

  

The core of this assessment lies in the development of your AI/ML product. You will need to preprocess the data by loading datasets, applying techniques to clean and scale features, and handling missing data. Following this, you will build and train your model using AI/ML algorithms, evaluate its accuracy using metrics like precision and recall, and optimize the model through techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

  

You can use the sandbox environment through Cloud Academy to create and optimize the AI/ML product. When ready, you will move the project to GitLab for submission.

Requirements

* * *

_Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide._

  

_You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course._

  

_Tasks may **not** be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt)._

  

**GitLab Repository**

A.  Create your subgroup and project in "[WGU GitLab Environment](https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/353990238)" and use the "[WGU Knowledge Center: WGU GitLab Environment](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Frequently-Asked-Questions/WGU-GitLab-Environment/ta-p/50512)" webpage to complete the following: 

1\.  Clone the project to the IDE.

2\.  Commit with a message and push when you complete each requirement listed in parts B1–B7.  
 

_Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a requirement is not yet complete._  
 

3\.  Submit a copy of the GitLab repository URL in the "Comments to Evaluator" section when you submit this assessment.

4\.  Submit a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your repository, which must include the commit messages and dates.

_Note: Wait until you have completed all of the following prompts before you create your copy of the repository branch history._

**Development of AI/ML Product**

B.  Develop your fully functional AI/ML product that addresses your identified business problem or organizational need from Task 1. 

**Data Preprocessing** 

1\.  Apply preprocessing techniques (e.g., converting categorical variables, data cleaning, handling missing data, and scaling features). When you are done, upload the preprocessed dataset to the GitLab repository. 

_Note: Remember to commit with a message and push your work to GitLab._

**Model Training** 

2\.  Build the AI/ML algorithm.

3\.  Train the model using the AI/ML algorithm.

4\.  Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

_Note: Remember to commit with a message and push your work to GitLab._

**Model Optimization** 

5\.  Apply cross-validation techniques. 

6\.  Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

_Note: Remember to commit with a message and push your work to GitLab._

**Readme File**

C.   Complete the README file provided in GitLab to include the following:  

1\.  requirements (software, hardware, etc.)

2\.  instructions to run the AI/ML application

D.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
